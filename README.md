# Global Education Inequality Analysis
üåç Global Education Inequality Analysis (2010‚Äì2021)

This project explores education inequality trends across 195 countries between 2010 and 2021, based on UNDP/UNESCO Human Development data.
The goal is to highlight regional disparities, development group differences, and relationships with HDI rankings using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

üìä Key Insights (from dataset)
	‚Ä¢	Global Trend:
Average education inequality declined slightly from ~17.8 in 2010 to ~16.5 in 2021, showing slow but steady progress.
	‚Ä¢	Regional Comparison:
	‚Ä¢	Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) shows the highest inequality, averaging above 25 throughout the period.
	‚Ä¢	Europe & Central Asia (ECA) consistently have the lowest inequality, around 5‚Äì8.
	‚Ä¢	South Asia (SA) shows gradual improvement but remains above the global average.
	‚Ä¢	Development Groups:
	‚Ä¢	Low HDI countries have inequality levels ~4x higher than Very High HDI countries.
	‚Ä¢	Very High HDI countries (like Germany, Australia, UAE) maintain near-minimal inequality.
	‚Ä¢	Top 5 Countries with Highest Inequality (2021):
	1.	Afghanistan (~45.3)
	2.	Angola (~34.1)
	3.	Chad (~33.9)
	4.	Central African Republic (~32.7)
	5.	Mozambique (~31.5)
	‚Ä¢	Lowest Inequality (2021):
	‚Ä¢	Germany, Australia, Norway, and Switzerland are among the best performers (<3).
	‚Ä¢	Correlation with HDI Rank (2021):
There is a strong positive correlation (r ‚âà 0.68) between worse HDI rank and higher education inequality.
